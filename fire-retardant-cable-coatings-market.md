<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Retardant Cable Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intumescent Fire Retardant Cable Coatings</li><li>Non-Intumescent Fire Retardant Cable Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire retardant cable coatings market is categorized into two primary types: intumescent and non-intumescent coatings. Intumescent fire retardant coatings swell upon exposure to heat, forming a protective layer that insulates the cable and reduces heat transfer. In contrast, non-intumescent coatings work by forming a barrier that inhibits flame spread and reduces smoke production without swelling. Both types serve to enhance the fire resistance of cables, ensuring safety in electrical installations across various industries.</p></p>
