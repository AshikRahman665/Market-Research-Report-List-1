<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-lock Brake Systems for Cars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-channel ABS</li><li>Two-channel ABS</li><li>Three-channel ABS</li><li>Four-channel ABS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS) are crucial for enhancing vehicle safety by preventing wheel lock-up during braking. There are four main types: One-channel ABS manages braking for a single wheel, typically on older vehicles. Two-channel ABS controls front wheels separately while combining rear-wheel inputs. Three-channel ABS offers independent control for two front wheels and one rear wheel, enhancing handling. Four-channel ABS is the most advanced, providing individual control for all four wheels, optimizing stability and control during emergency braking scenarios.</p></p>
