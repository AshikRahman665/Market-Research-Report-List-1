<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li><li>Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor market consists of two main types: selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors. Selective COX-2 inhibitors specifically target the COX-2 enzyme, reducing pain and inflammation with fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs. In contrast, non-selective COX-2 inhibitors inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, providing broader anti-inflammatory effects but potentially increasing gastrointestinal risks. This differentiation influences prescribing practices based on individual patient needs and risk factors.</p></p>
