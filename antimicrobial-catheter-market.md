<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antimicrobial Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Central Venous Catheters</li><li>Urinary Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antimicrobial catheter market is primarily divided into two main types: central venous catheters (CVCs) and urinary catheters. Central venous catheters are inserted into large veins to deliver medications or fluids and monitor hemodynamics, incorporating antimicrobial coatings to reduce infection risks. Urinary catheters, on the other hand, are used to drain urine from the bladder and can also be treated with antimicrobial agents to minimize catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Both types enhance patient safety and improve healthcare outcomes.</p></p>
